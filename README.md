Simple-Sudoku-Solver
====================

This is a simple Sudoku Solver. It also generates random Sudokus*

*Some of them didn't have an achievable solution when I created it last year. I'll try to fix it ASAP.

At this moment it uses a BT algorithm....maybe it would be a good idea to get a better one if possible.


Run sudoku.class and then you can input your own sudoku and solve it, or generate a random one and solve it.


I'll be updating the project tomorrow.
